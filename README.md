The hiero-contracts project has the purpose of exposing, grouping all the system-contracts, hiero hooks and any solidity interfaces or extension points of the hiero network. The solidity contracts will be packaged on an npm library, facilitating system contract interfacing to the community, in an open-zeppelin style.
